ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The given project uses Justpy and Highcharts to visualize data that is obtained from the Dataset about the certain set of courses in udemy and use several functionality available in the highcharts 

INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

To build this app we need to install a few Python libraries. 
justpy (library for building web apps and data visualization):
pandas (library for data analysis)
pytz (library for datetime calculations between timezones)
matplotlib (library for quick data visualization)
jupyter (library that enables a reach interactive Python shell)

METHODOLOGIES:

The dataset containing the reviews of the courses are obtained and is displayed using pandas in jupyter notebook
